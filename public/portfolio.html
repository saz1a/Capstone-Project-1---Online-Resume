    <h2>CFG Course -Introduction to Python & Apps </h2>
    <h3>Spreadsheet Analysis with Python</h3>
    <p>As a participant in the CFG Course "Introduction to Python & Apps," I had the opportunity to undertake the Data Analysis task. Alongside fulfilling the requirements of the project brief, I also explored data manipulation and visualization using powerful libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, and Matplotlib. Exploring these tools has been a genuinely enjoyable and enriching experience for me.</p>
        <p>Project Brief:

                <ol>3.	Output the total sales across all months</ol>
